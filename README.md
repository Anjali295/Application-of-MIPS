# Application-of-MIPS
This project contains the fundamentals of assembly language MIPS.
It contains 5 parts. The 1st part checks whether the string is valid or not. The 2nd part converts the binary number to decimal number and sign extends the answer. The 3rd part converts hex string to 32-bit binary number and decodes the R-Type instructions. It evaluates the six components of R-Type instructions - Opcode, rs, rt, rd registers, shamt , funct . The 4th part converts the hex string to 32-bit floating point number in IEEE-754. It handles the special cases and gives error for invalid arguments. Then the program stores the exponent in the register $a0 and the mantissa (fraction ) part in label mantissa. Finally the 5th part verifies the hand in the Loot Card Game. Each player has a combination of pirate and merchant ships for a total of 6 cards. 
A merchant ship card has a digit [3-8] associated with it, which indicates the gold coins in a merchant ship. A pirate ship card has a digit [1-4] associated with it to indicate the strength of a pirate ship. The input given by the user contains the type of the ship and the strength indicated by the number. The program counts the number of pirate and merchant ships and then prints the signed decimal equivalent of the binary representation of the number and terminates.
This project highly enhanced my way of thinking in lower level language.
